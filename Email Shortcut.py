    a = "Hello Sir/Madam,\nCompany's goal has always been to educate and spread computer science awareness. Looking up to do the same has been my goal. My team and I have come up with an event called MissionHacks(a Hackathon), where we can do the same. My name is Mihit and I am the Director of Technology at MissionHacks. We are a non-profit organization hosting a Hackathon in October 2019. We are hosting this Hackathon to enrich and encourage Computer Science to children of all ages. Our team at MissionHacks would be glad if Company would be willing to sponsor our Hackathon as your platform is so amazing and having you as our sponsor and partner would be even better. In order to support our Hackathon, we are in need of cash. We were wondering if Company would be willing to sponsor anything to support our Hackathon at 42 Silicon Valley. We are even hosting workshops and would love to include Company and have you as a partner. We would also put your name on our t-shirts to advertise Company. We are hosting one of the largest Hackathons in the Bay Area and this can only be possible with your help. Thank you so much for your time and we look forward to working with you! \n\n\n\n\n\nMihit Shukla || Director of Technology || MissionHacksMission Hacks EIN number:464748165 \nWebsite:missionhacks.org \nInstagram: @missionhacks \nFacebook: Mission Hacks \nTwitter: @HacksMission"
